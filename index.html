    <h2>Women in strength sports</h2>
        <p>(Olympic) Weightlifting is the only stregnth based sport that's part of the Olympic games. Hence some often call it 'Olympic Weightlifting' to differentiate weightlifting from other strength-based sports like Powerlifting. 
            
            CrossFit's exploding popularity, or maybe [notoriety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etOnWu9Qlss&pp=ygUcY3Jvc3NmaXQgZmFpbHMgZWxnaW50ZW5zaXR5IA%3D%3D), have increased interest and participation in strength-sports overall along with social media channels dedicated to featuring weightlifters training and competing.  
            
            Named after how weightlifters will hold onto the barbell when performing the two competition lifts, [hookgrip](https://www.instagram.com/hookgrip/) is *the* weightlifting brand. Think Gymshark but for competitive athletes rather than influencers. Brands like hookgrip and [ATG](https://www.instagram.com/atginsta/) (short for ass-to-grass meaning your hips going as low as possible, resulting in your ass touching the metaphorical grass floor when squatting) are pivotal in bringing weightlifting to the gym-going casual public like myself. 
            
            Who these pages chose to feature can impact an athelete's career, both during and outside of their competing days. Think getting brand sponsorships, building a large enough audience to cultivate into potential clientele to offer coaching courses[^1](toroktiy.com) when their careers are over. 
            
            As weightlifting becomes more accessible to the public, featuring a more diverse range of atheltes is critical in promoting the sport among under represented groups. Among women, the stigma remains that touching a weight will instantly turn them into a female version of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watchinng the amazing female atheletes on hookgrip or atginsta shows a much different picture. Weightlifters come in all different shapes and sizes. And no, you won't instantly become bulky from lifting weights. Trust me I've tried, it's really hard! </p>
            
        <h2>So with all that in mind, let's see who the most popular weightlifter on hookgrip is</h2>
