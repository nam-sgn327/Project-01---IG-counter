This was also the heaviest snatch of the entire meet including all classes.  In addition to this being an awesome lift, I am also posting this because I've gotten the question \"what app is this\" a couple hundred times on the slow mo videos.  The answer is that we do not use an app to make the videos, we shoot the videos at 240 frames per second -- about 8 times more frames are captured than by a normal video camera.  This video of Jared shows what it looks like when you use an \"app\" (like Twixtor, a plugin for Final Cut Pro) to slow down a video shot at normal speed -- he is moving too fast for the camera to see every position.  Slow motion can't be done with an app!\n",
