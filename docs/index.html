                <p class="credit super-font">By Nam Tran</p>
                <p class="intro">Named after how weightlifters will hold onto the barbell when performing the two competition lifts, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hookgrip/">hookgrip</a> is <b>the</b> weightlifting brand. Think Gymshark but for competitive athletes rather than influencers. Let's see who their favourite athlete to film is. </p>
        <h2>Women in strength sports</h2>

        </p>
        
        <p>Hookgrip is the top-of-mind channel dedicated for the  weightlifting enthusiast. Being the only strength-based sport represented in the Olympic games, it's often called (Olympic) weightlifting to differentiate from other barbell sports like Powerlifting.  
             
        <p>Brands like hookgrip and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/atginsta/">ATG</a> (short for ass-to-grass meaning your hips going as low as possible, resulting in your ass touching the metaphorical grass floor when squatting) provide the gym-going casual public with high production value weightlifting content. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Who these brands chose to feature can impact an athelete's career, both during and outside of their competing days. Think getting <a href="https://www.ascentprotein.com/blogs/athletes/jourdan-delacruz">brand sponsorships</a>, building a large enough audience to cultivate into potential clientele to offer <a href="https://torokhtiy.com/">coaching courses</a> after retirement.</p>
            
        <p>Featuring a more diverse range of atheltes is critical in promoting the sport among under represented groups. Among women, the stigma remains that touching a weight will instantly turn them into a female version of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watching the amazing women on hookgrip or atg reveals that no, you won't instantly become bulky from lifting weights. Trust me I've tried, it's really hard! </p>
            
        <h2>So with all that in mind, let's see who the most popular weightlifter on hookgrip is</h2>
        <iframe title="3 out of the Top 10 most popular lifters are female" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-n5KK1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/n5KK1/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="362" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>

        <p>As expected, Georgian super heavyweight <a href="https://www.instagram.com/talakhadzelasha_official/">Lasha Talakhadze</a> enjoys the cozy throne of being social media's most prolific weightlifter. Deservedly so given his frequent competing schedule and constant world-record defying lifts. It takes a rare talent where the only person you have to worry about beating in international competitions is yourself. </p>

        <p>To my suprise, hookgrip's 2nd favourite lifter to post about was female! American <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattierogersoly/">Mattie Rogers (81kg)</a> is the runner up to Lasha's number 01 spot. American women have a strong presence on the page with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jourdannn_14/">Jourdan Delacruz (49kg)</a> also within the top 10, behind former world-record holder Loredana Toma (71kg, Romania). Along with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cj__cummings/">C.J Cummings</a> featuring within the top 5 despite his sparse competition schedule, it seems that hookgrip does give home court advantage to their compatriots. Unsurprising since this is where I would expect the majority of their merchandise to be sold.</p>

        <h2>In the beginning there were big Soviet men lifting big weights...</h2>

        <p>The Soviet (and former Soviet) greats brought weightlifting to us filthy casuals with big numbers and aesthetics abs to boot. Along with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/klokovd/">Klokov (105kg)</a> came goodbye to DYEL ('do you even lift') and hello to near-single digit body fat year round, making weightlifting pretty appeaking even for the crowd who only care about aesthetics. Unfortunately <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1120032/klokov-among-weightlifters-doping-charge">drug scandals</a> meant that the early pioneers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ilyailyinforever/">Ilya (94 kg) </a>, Klokov, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aukhadov/">Aukhadov</a> had their careers interrupted and all but dissapeared in the mid-teens. Alas we shall strive to remember their aesthetic physique and be wary of state-sponsorred doping.</p>

        <p>At the end of the Soviet era came the reign of Lasha and the Chinese weightlifting team who maintain and iron-grip over the medals table to the current day. Lifters like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tiantao89kg1/">Tian Tiao</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shi_zhi_yong/">Shi Zhiyong</a> who would usher in wow aesthetics and body-envy to the light-middle weight classes. Lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I0ZndiXDVY&pp=ygUVdGlhbiBoZWFydCBhdHRhY2sgdGFv">heart attacks</a> and lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehOEX60lng">wocaos</a> abound.</p>

        <p>American athletes were the trend setters in the women's lifting scene, since the baby-days of lifting instagram and up til today. Although retired <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kingmorghan/">Morghan King</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicalucero9/">Jessica Lucero</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maddy.myers1/">Maddy Myers</a> paved the scene for women to participate in weightlifting or its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XNcEFPXif0">infamous chaotic evil cousin</a>: Crossfit.</p>
        <p>Should they make it through the insanely tough qualifying procedures, Jourdan Delacruz, Mattie Rogers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katevibert/">Kate Vibert (71kg)</a> are all on their way to being 2-time Olympians. Rising stars from the non-Anglophone world like the Dajomes sisters <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angiedajomes/">Angie</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/neisi_dajomes/">Neisi</a>  with the war-paint and the fiery <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cmv.valentina18/">Mihaela Cambei (49kg, Romania)</a> make it an exciting time to get into the sport, especially for women. </p>
